Introduction To Machine Learning:

Undoubtedly, Machine Learning is the most in-demand technology in today’s market. Its applications range from self-driving cars to predicting deadly diseases such as ALS. The high demand for Machine Learning skills is the motivation behind this blog. In this blog on Introduction To Machine Learning, you will understand all the basic concepts of Machine Learning and a Practical Implementation of Machine Learning by using the R language
Need For Machine Learning
Ever since the technical revolution, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data. As per research, we generate around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day! It is estimated that by 2020, 1.7MB of data will be created every second for every person on earth.
With the availability of so much data, it is finally possible to build predictive models that can study and analyze complex data to find useful insights and deliver more accurate results.
Top Tier companies such as Netflix and Amazon build such Machine Learning models by using tons of data in order to identify profitable opportunities and avoid unwanted risks.
Here’s a list of reasons why Machine Learning is so important:
Increase in Data Generation: Due to excessive production of data, we need a method that can be used to structure, analyze and draw useful insights from data. This is where Machine Learning comes in. It uses data to solve problems and find solutions to the most complex tasks faced by organizations.
Improve Decision Making: By making use of various algorithms, Machine Learning can be used to make better business decisions. For example, Machine Learning is used to forecast sales, predict downfalls in the stock market, identify risks and anomalies, etc.

Introduction To Machine Learning
Uncover patterns & trends in data:

Finding hidden patterns and extracting key insights from data is the most essential part of Machine Learning. By building predictive models and using statistical techniques, Machine Learning allows you to dig beneath the surface and explore the data at a minute scale. Understanding data and extracting patterns manually will take days, whereas Machine Learning algorithms can perform such computations in less than a second.
Solve complex problems: From detecting the genes linked to the deadly ALS disease to building self-driving cars, Machine Learning can be used to solve the most complex problems.

Machine Learning Types

A machine can learn to solve a problem by following any one of the following three approaches. These are the ways in which a machine can learn:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning
 Supervised learning is a technique in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled. 
To understand Supervised Learning let’s consider an analogy. As kids we all needed guidance to solve math problems. Our teachers helped us understand what addition is and how it is done. Similarly, you can think of supervised learning as a type of Machine Learning that involves a guide. The labeled data set is the teacher that will train you to understand patterns in the data. The labeled data set is nothing but the training data set.

Unsupervised Learning
 Unsupervised learning involves training by using unlabeled data and allowing the model to act on that information without guidance. 
Think of unsupervised learning as a smart kid that learns without any guidance. In this type of Machine Learning, the model is not fed with labeled data, as in the model has no clue that ‘this image is Tom and this is Jerry’, it figures out patterns and the differences between Tom and Jerry on its own by taking in tons of data.

Type Of Problems In Machine Learning

Type of Problems Solved Using Machine Learning – Introduction To Machine Learning – there are three main types of problems that can be solved in Machine Learning:
Regression: In this type of problem the output is a continuous quantity. So, for example, if you want to predict the speed of a car given the distance, it is a Regression problem. Regression problems can be solved by using Supervised Learning algorithms like Linear Regression.
Classification: In this type, the output is a categorical value. Classifying emails into two classes, spam and non-spam is a classification problem that can be solved by using Supervised Learning classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, etc.
Clustering: This type of problem involves assigning the input into two or more clusters based on feature similarity. For example, clustering viewers into similar groups based on their interests, age, geography, etc can be done by using Unsupervised Learning algorithms like K-Means Clustering.
