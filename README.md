Introduction To Machine Learning:
Undoubtedly, Machine Learning is the most in-demand technology in today’s market. Its applications range from self-driving cars to predicting deadly diseases such as ALS. The high demand for Machine Learning skills is the motivation behind this blog. In this blog on Introduction To Machine Learning, you will understand all the basic concepts of Machine Learning and a Practical Implementation of Machine Learning by using the R language
Need For Machine Learning
Ever since the technical revolution, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data. As per research, we generate around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day! It is estimated that by 2020, 1.7MB of data will be created every second for every person on earth.
With the availability of so much data, it is finally possible to build predictive models that can study and analyze complex data to find useful insights and deliver more accurate results.
Top Tier companies such as Netflix and Amazon build such Machine Learning models by using tons of data in order to identify profitable opportunities and avoid unwanted risks.
Here’s a list of reasons why Machine Learning is so important:
Increase in Data Generation: Due to excessive production of data, we need a method that can be used to structure, analyze and draw useful insights from data. This is where Machine Learning comes in. It uses data to solve problems and find solutions to the most complex tasks faced by organizations.
Improve Decision Making: By making use of various algorithms, Machine Learning can be used to make better business decisions. For example, Machine Learning is used to forecast sales, predict downfalls in the stock market, identify risks and anomalies, etc.

Importance Of Machine Learning – Introduction To Machine Learning – Edureka
Uncover patterns & trends in data: Finding hidden patterns and extracting key insights from data is the most essential part of Machine Learning. By building predictive models and using statistical techniques, Machine Learning allows you to dig beneath the surface and explore the data at a minute scale. Understanding data and extracting patterns manually will take days, whereas Machine Learning algorithms can perform such computations in less than a second.
Solve complex problems: From detecting the genes linked to the deadly ALS disease to building self-driving cars, Machine Learning can be used to solve the most complex problems.
